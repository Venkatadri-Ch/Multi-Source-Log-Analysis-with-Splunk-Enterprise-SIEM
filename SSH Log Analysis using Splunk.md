# Analyzing SSH Logs Using Splunk SIEM

### Introduction 

SSH (Secure Shell) log files hold important details about whoâ€™s accessing your servers remotely  including login attempts, commands run, and session activity. By analyzing these logs in Splunk SIEM, security teams can keep a close eye on access to critical systems, quickly spot unusual behavior, and identify potential security threats before they become serious issues.

### Objective 

The goal of this project is to analyze SSH authentication logs to detect:

- Successful logins (who connected, from where)
- Failed login attempts (possible brute-force or password spraying)
- Multiple failed authentication attempts (indicators of brute-force)
- Connections without authentication (potential scanning or incomplete sessions)

### Prerequisites

- Splunk is installed and configured.
