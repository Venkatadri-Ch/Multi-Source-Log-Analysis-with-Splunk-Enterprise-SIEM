### Introduction

DNS (Domain Name System) logs are essential for understanding whatâ€™s happening on a network and spotting potential security issues. Using Splunk SIEM, these logs can be analyzed effectively to detect unusual behavior or signs of malicious activity. In this project, we focus on collecting, analyzing, and visualizing DNS logs to gain actionable insights and improve network security monitoring.

### Prerequisites


Before analyzing DNS logs in Splunk, ensure the following:

- Splunk instance is installed and configured.

- DNS log data.

### Steps to Upload Sample DNS Log File to Splunk SIEM

  ### 1. Prepare Sample DNS Log Files
