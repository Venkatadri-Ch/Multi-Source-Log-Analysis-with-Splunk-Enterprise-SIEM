# Analyzing FTP Log Files Using Splunk SIEM

### Introduction

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) logs record all the file transfer activity that happens across a network. When analyzed with Splunk, these logs can reveal a lot, from whoâ€™s transferring files to unusual patterns that might signal a security issue. This project shows how to use Splunk SIEM to analyze FTP log data, making it easier to monitor activity, spot anomalies, and strengthen overall network security.

## Prerequisites
- Splunk is installed and configured.
