# Analyzing HTTP Logs Using Splunk SIEM

### Introduction

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) logs provide important insights into web server activity, capturing details such as requests, responses, user agents, and other relevant information. By analyzing these logs using Splunk SIEM, security professionals can effectively monitor web traffic, detect unusual patterns, and identify potential security threats.

### Project Overview

In this project, we will upload sample HTTP logs into Splunk SIEM and analyze them to gain insights into web server activity across the network. The analysis will help us understand traffic patterns, identify anomalies, and explore potential security concerns.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the project, ensure the following:

- Splunk is installed and configured.
- HTTP log dataset.
