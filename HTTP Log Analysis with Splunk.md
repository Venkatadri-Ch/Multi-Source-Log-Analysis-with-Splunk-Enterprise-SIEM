# Analyzing HTTP Logs Using Splunk SIEM

### Introduction

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) logs provide important insights into web server activity, capturing details such as requests, responses, user agents, and other relevant information. By analyzing these logs using Splunk SIEM, security professionals can effectively monitor web traffic, detect unusual patterns, and identify potential security threats.

### Project Overview

In this project, we will upload sample HTTP logs into Splunk SIEM and analyze them to gain insights into web server activity across the network. The analysis will help us understand traffic patterns, identify anomalies, and explore potential security concerns.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the project, ensure the following:

- Splunk is installed and configured.
- HTTP log dataset.

Note: The steps to upload the sample HTTP log to Splunk are the same as those used for the previous DNS log analysis.

I have given the source type name as httplogs and the description as This is HTTP log data.

# Analyzing HTTP Logs with Splunk

### 1. Search for HTTP Events

Open the Splunk interface and go to the Search bar.
To view the HTTP events, run the following search query:
```
index=_* or index=* sourcetype=httplogs
```
This query retrieves all the HTTP events from the specified index and source type.

### 2. Extracted Fields

Using the same field extraction steps as in the previous DNS log analysis, I extracted the src_port, dst_port, and status (I mean HTTP status codes) fields.

Here, we can see the HTTP status codes, HTTP status codes are standardized three-digit codes returned by web servers in response to client requests.
They indicate whether a request has been successfully completed, redirected, or resulted in an error.

### 3. HTTP Status Code Analysis

 ```
 index=* sourcetype=httplogs
| stats count by status
```
This SPL command helps us to monitor and analyze HTTP status codes generated by web servers.
It shows how many times each status code appeared in the logs, giving quick insight into the overall health and security posture of web applications.

### 4.Top Destination Ports Analysis
```
index=* sourcetype=httplogs
| top limit=dst_port
```
This is useful for network monitoring and threat detection. By checking which destination ports are being accessed most often, analysts can understand normal traffic patterns and quickly spot unusual activity.

### 5. Detecting Anomalies in File Transfer Activity
```
index=* sourcetype=httplogs
| timechart span=1h count
```
It creates a time chart that shows the number of events or file transfers each hour.
If the chart shows a sudden increase or decrease in activity, it might mean something unusual is happening .For example, a lot of files being transferred at once or the service not working properly.

This helps us understand normal file transfer patterns and quickly notice when something looks different.

<img width="924" height="400" alt="time chart 8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8308e8ed-b5ee-450a-9f42-601ab9989ef3" />

### 6. Analyzing High Volumes of Error Responses
```
index=* sourcetype=httplogs
| stats count by status
| where status >= 400
```
It searches our HTTP logs, counts how many times each status code appears, and then filters to show only those with status codes 400 and above.

These status codes represent client and server errors .
If you see a high number of these errors, it could mean something is wrong  such as broken links, misconfigurations, or issues with the web server. This helps us easily identify when too many errors are happening and which types are most common.

<img width="929" height="413" alt="stats count fourhundred 9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dcde769-f230-4dec-b979-f887078a39f7" />

### 7. Identifying Failed Login Attempts
```
index=* sourcetype=httplogs action="login" status=404
| stats count by src_ip 
| sort -count
```
This SPL command helps find which IP addresses are generating failed login attempts.

<img width="934" height="415" alt="which client IPs are generating the most failed login attempts 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa1c7647-c33b-4541-ad5d-d59e049ff270" />

The IP 192.168.202.110 generated the most failed login attempts (442), suggesting possible brute force activity or misconfiguration , the other IPs show significantly fewer failed attempts.

## Conclusion 

After analyzing the HTTP logs, I was able to understand how the web traffic behaves and how the server is performing. By checking status codes, destination ports, traffic patterns, errors, and login activity, I could spot unusual patterns and identify issues. This analysis helped me see where things are working well and where there might be problems, making it easier to ensure the web services run smoothly.
